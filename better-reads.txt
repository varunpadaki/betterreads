When there is huge data in single table relational DB does not perform well.

Use of clustering key in cassandra ==> It orders the data at the time of insertion into database.So that we get the data in the specific order when we query.
And this is not done at runtime and hence it increases the performance when doing a fetch.

Books_by_author_id ==> List down all books by authorID
Books_By_ID ==> Get Book info by ID

User_book_by_bookID_UID ==> get book rating and markings by user based on userid and bookid
User_books_by_userid ==> get all books for a loggedin user


Books_By_ID
bookid - Partition key and Primary Key
name
desc
cover
authorname
authorID

Books_By_Author_id
author_id - partitionKey
publisheddate - clustering key,Decending
name
bookid
bookname
cover

Primary key = author_id+published_dt


Books_by_userid_and_bookid
user_id - partitionkey
book_id - partitionkey
startdate
enddate
rating
status

Primarykey = user_id+book_id

Books_by_user_id
user_id - partitionkey
status - clustering key,ascending
timeUuid - clusteringkey,descending
book_id
rating

user_id++status+timeUuid = primary key


API - 
1)BookController = /better-reads/books/{bookId} - Get book By ID
Search books and click on book to fetch book Info By ID
This API also returns the User interaction with Book if the user has logged in (reference UserBooksController GET /better-reads/users/{userId}/books/{bookId})

Table - book_by_id,book_by_user_and_bookid


2)DashboardController = /better-reads/dashboard/{userId}
Loads books post login for the user.
Table - books_by_user

3)SearchBookController = /better-reads/search/books
Use 3rd party API and get search result and display in UI
User can search wooks with or without login

4)UserBooksController = GET /better-reads/users/{userId}/books/{bookId}
To get user interaction with book if present

To save user interaction with books
